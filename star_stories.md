Tanya Melnikova	
Tell us about yourself?
I worked as a teacher for the first decade of my life. I got to the top of the language teaching profession and saw that I really had nowhere else to go.
Steve Jobs said "Stay hungry. Stay foolish". I looked around and saw that I had always been "hungry" for computers. I felt very foolish but I was hungry. I am learning, and the more I learn the more I know that I know nothing. I am still foolish and I am still hungry. That's what making me go forward.

**coworkers:** contact with colleagues that promotes a sense of belonging.  
**creativity and self-expression:** working in a job in which I use my imagination to find new ways to do/say something.  

- When I came to Calvary Chapel, I saw that the work of the department was barely going. I saw the need to expand the staff and the services. I recruited 15 people, organized them in groups, and started creating a new curriculum. In a matter of months the attendance more than doubled. 
- When I was working at Calvary Chapel there was a situation when I saw I needed to start delegating duties to other team members. I saw one fellow that knew how to do it, but I wasn't sure he would do it the right way. If I allowed him, I would probabpy cause a mistake. But I went ahead and allowed him and the people liked the variety that resulted. 
- When I was working at CC, I saw the need to organize another department. I saw the interest in kids and organized a new department. I saw that to be successful we had to do some serious training. I knew that it was not necessary to go that serious, but I did it anyway. As a result the attendance of the group grew within several weeks.  

## Why computer programming as a career?
I had always been fascinated with computers and the internet, and people who understand how to deal with them. 
For me Computer programming has always associated with prestige. I wanted to be part of the IT crowd. Not use the computer as a tool but also know how to tell it what to do.
